    "bio":"Learn | Analyze | Design | Create. These four words best describe my work style and how I think. I believe everything we do in life is a process (daily routine, business model, etc.). I enjoy using data to extract hidden truths, display findings in a clean-attractive way for others to understand and enjoy creating scalable automated processes to continuously improve and/or build on. This is why I naturally fell in love with coding. I am currently looking for a company to continue my journey (full-stack web development or data science) and am excited to see how my business background interlocks with the coding world!",
